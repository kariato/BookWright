Here is a rough outline for an AI Book Writing Assistant:

1. **Introduction**
   - Purpose of the application
   - Main features

2. **User Interface (UI) and Experience (UX)**
   - Intuitive text editor
   - Real-time suggestions
   - **Chat Boxes for Discussion**
     - Each screen includes an integrated chat box to discuss the current content, brainstorm ideas, or request clarifications.
     - Options for both AI conversations (e.g., clarifying prompts, suggestions) and human collaboration (e.g., co-authors/editors).
   - **Rollback / Revision Feature**
     - Allow users to revert to earlier states of the document or database records.
     - Could leverage a version control table or track changes per screen (chapters, scenes, characters, prompts, etc.).
     - Facilitate a quick undo of undesired changes or revert to a previous draft.

3. **Backend and Model Infrastructure**
   - Large Language Model integration
   - Fine-tuning approach

4. **Key Features**
   - **Dynamic prompting**
     - Offers both user-driven prompts and AI-initiated suggestions to guide the writing process.
   - **Story development modules**
     - Includes a character generator, chapter outlines, and other narrative tools.
     - **Chapter Database**:
       - Store each chapter as a database record (e.g., chapter number, title, summary).
       - Maintain a list of scenes linked to the chapter record.
     - **Scene Database**:
       - Store each scene as a separate record (e.g., location, time, summary, etc.).
       - Sub-parts of each scene are additional records linked to the main scene, capturing beats or key events within that scene.
       - Create relational links between sub-scenes and character interactions or traits (for instance, tracking how a specific character’s traits or relationships evolve during the sub-scene).
     - **Character Database**:
       - Store each character as a database record with unique identifiers (e.g., name, role, etc.).
       - Separate tables or entities for character traits (e.g., personality, skills), character history (backstory details), and interactions.
       - Link character interactions to scenes, tracking dialogue lines, emotional states, and relationships.
     - **Prompt Database**:
       - Maintain a record of both user-driven and AI-generated prompts.
       - Fields might include prompt text, context, time-stamp, user ID, and usage frequency.
       - Use for future reference or fine-tuning by analyzing which prompts are most effective.
   - **AI-driven editing suggestions**
     - Focuses on grammar, style, and voice consistency with a built-in rewriting engine.
   - **Stage-by-Stage Tips**
     - Provide customized advice or next steps based on where the writer is in the story development (e.g., brainstorming, drafting, revising).
     - Offer best practices for each phase (e.g., outlining key conflicts in the planning phase, adding detail in the drafting phase, or refining voice in the revision phase).
   - **Additional Features and Enhancements**
     - **Version Control / Revision History**: Track changes, compare revisions, and roll back to previous versions.
     - **Analytics & Writing Metrics**: Real-time statistics on word count, reading level, pacing analysis, etc.
     - **Theme & Tone Consistency**: Define or select a specific mood, genre, or tone and ensure consistency across the text.
     - **Style Profiles & Personalization**: Create or follow style guides; let the AI learn users’ writing habits.
     - **World-Building Tools** (For fantasy/sci-fi): Lore, world history, factions, mythologies, timelines.
     - **Collaboration Features**: Invite co-authors or editors to collaborate in real time.
     - **Publishing Pipeline**: Export options (EPUB, MOBI) or direct integration with publishing platforms.
     - **Project Management Dashboard**: High-level overview of progress, upcoming tasks, and timeline.
     - **Research & Inspiration Hub**: Store references, links, and notes for factual or world-building data.
     - **Community or Marketplace** (Optional): Share or discover character templates, scene ideas, and outlines.

5. **Roadmap**
   - Phase 1: MVP with basic text generation
   - Phase 2: Integrate advanced story tools (including detailed character, chapter, and scene databases)
   - Phase 3: Improve personalization & style
